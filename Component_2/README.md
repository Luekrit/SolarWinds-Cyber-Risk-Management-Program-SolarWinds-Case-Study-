# 🧱 Component 2 – Developing Methods for Evaluating and Monitoring Cyber Risk Management

## 🧠 Overview
This component focuses on establishing **systematic methods for evaluating and continuously monitoring cyber risk** within SolarWinds Corporation. Using **Customer Records** as a case study, this section demonstrates both **qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques**, development of **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**, and the implementation of a **Continuous Monitoring Plan**.

Customer records are classified as **Very High Sensitivity** due to their financial, operational, and regulatory significance. They contain **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and are subject to stringent privacy and data protection laws (The SANS Institute, 2021). As such, they are considered **high-priority assets** requiring advanced protection and proactive monitoring.

---

## 🧩 2.1 – Qualitative Risk Assessment

### 🧠 Objective
To identify and prioritize potential risks to **Customer Records** through expert judgment and **risk matrix analysis**, helping determine which threats pose the most significant danger to SolarWinds’ data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### 📋 Methodology
The **Qualitative Risk Assessment** uses a **Risk Matrix** approach to assess the likelihood and impact of various threats. This process leverages **expert consultation**, threat modeling, and industry standards (NIST SP 800-30, ISO/IEC 27005). Each risk is rated based on **Impact** (Low/Medium/High) and **Likelihood** (Low/Medium/High), and assigned an **Overall Risk Level**.

High-priority risks are flagged for immediate attention, while medium and low risks are documented for ongoing monitoring.

---

### 🧮 Example: Qualitative Risk Assessment for Customer Records
| Risk Description | Impact Level | Likelihood Level | Risk Level |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Data Breach** – Unauthorized access to PII by external attackers or insiders | High | Medium | High |
| **Data Loss** – Accidental or intentional deletion of customer records | High | Medium | High |
| **Ransomware Attack** – Encryption of customer records leading to data inaccessibility | High | Medium | High |
| **Insider Threat** – Misuse or leak of customer data by employees or contractors | High | Medium | High |
| **Regulatory Non-Compliance** – Mishandling customer data, violating GDPR/CCPA | High | Low | Medium |
| **Data Integrity Issues** – Unauthorized alteration or corruption of records | High | Medium | High |
| **Third-Party Risks** – Exposure of customer data via vendor vulnerabilities | High | Medium | High |
| **Phishing Attacks** – Credential compromise leading to unauthorized access | Medium | High | High |
| **Physical Theft** – Devices or servers containing customer data stolen | Medium | Low | Medium |
| **Unsecured Data Transmission** – Interception during transfer | High | Low | Medium |


---

### 🔍 Key Observations
- **High Risk:** Data Breach, Data Loss, Ransomware, Insider Threats, and Third-Party Risks.  
- **Medium Risk:** Physical Theft, Regulatory Non-Compliance, and Unsecured Data Transmission.  
- **High Frequency & Impact Threats** are prioritized for **mitigation controls** such as encryption, MFA, data loss prevention (DLP), and vendor assessment.

✅ *This section provides a structured qualitative risk overview for Customer Records, establishing the foundation for Component 2.2 (Quantitative Risk Assessment), where financial estimations and probabilistic modeling will be applied to measure potential loss.*

---

# 🧱 Component 2.2 – Quantitative Risk Assessment

## 🧠 Objective
To quantify potential financial losses and prioritize mitigation strategies for **Customer Records** by calculating **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**, **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**, and **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**. This approach provides measurable risk data for decision-making and supports cost-benefit analysis in later components.

---

## 🧩 Description
While qualitative risk assessment highlights priority risks, quantitative risk assessment **assigns numerical values** to potential losses. This analysis translates security threats into **financial terms**, enabling SolarWinds to make **data-driven investment decisions** on mitigation controls.

The formula used for financial quantification is:
> **ALE = SLE × ARO**

Where:
- **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** = Expected loss per incident.
- **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)** = Frequency of incidents per year.
- **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** = Projected yearly financial loss from each risk.

---

## 🧮 Risk Calculation Examples
### Example – Customer Records Risk Scenarios

**Identified Risks:**
- Data Breach  
- Data Loss  
- Ransomware Attack  
- Insider Threat  
- Regulatory Non-Compliance  
- Data Integrity Issues  
- Third-Party Risks

| Third-Party Risks | 1,500,000 | 0.06 | 90,000 |
| Phishing Attacks | 500,000 | 0.15 | 75,000 |
| Physical Theft | 600,000 | 0.05 | 30,000 |
| Unsecured Data Transmission | 1,000,000 | 0.04 | 40,000 |

**Total Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE):**
> ALE_Total = 250,000 + 120,000 + 200,000 + 120,000 + 150,000 + 64,000 + 90,000 + 75,000 + 30,000 + 40,000  
> **ALE_Total = $1,139,000 per year**
