# 🧩 SolarWinds Cyber Risk Management Program (SolarWinds Case Study)

**Author:** Luekrit Kongkamon 
**Duration:** September 2024 – November 2024  
**Role:** Cyber Risk Analyst (Academic Project)  
**Frameworks & Tools:** NIST SP 800-30 | ISO 27001 | BIA | CIA Triad | CIS Controls | SIEM | EDR | ROSI | TCO  

## 🧠 Overview
This project presents a **Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy** tailored to **SolarWinds Corporation (My SolarWinds Case Study)**. The program is divided into three key categories:


- **Category 1:** Focuses on **asset evaluation** by classifying SolarWinds’ **physical, digital, and human assets** through **CIA Triad** and **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** to determine their **criticality and sensitivity**.
- **Category 2:** Emphasizes **risk evaluation and monitoring** through **qualitative and quantitative assessments**, **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**, and a **structured periodic review** to adapt to evolving threats.
- **Category 3:** Prioritizes **cost-effective risk treatments**, performing **cost-benefit analysis** and implementing **security controls with measurable metrics** to enhance **SolarWinds’ cybersecurity resilience**.

## 🧱 Component 1: Risk Identification
- Created a complete **asset inventory** across physical, digital, and human resources.  
- Assigned **CIA Triad ratings** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) for each asset.  
- Conducted **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** with quantitative metrics to estimate **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**.  
- Please check readme.md in component_1 for full details [Risk Identification](Component_1#readme).
---

## 📈 Component 2: Risk Assessment & Analysis
- Applied **Qualitative Assessment** using expert judgment and risk matrices.  
- Applied **Quantitative Assessment** using **SLE × ARO = ALE** formula to quantify financial risk exposure.  
- Defined **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** to track threat trends (e.g., incident frequency, detection time, patching delays).  
- Developed a **Continuous Monitoring Plan** integrating **SIEM**, **EDR**, and **Threat Intelligence Feeds** for real-time visibility.  
- Please check readme.md in component_2 for full details [Risk Assessment & Analysis](Component_2#readme).
---

## 💰 Component 3: Risk Treatment & Cost-Effectiveness
- Evaluated four main **risk treatment options**: Avoidance, Reduction, Transfer, and Acceptance.  
- Prioritized **security controls** (e.g., EDR, phishing training, patch management) using **CIS Controls v8** alignment.  
- Conducted **Cost-Benefit Analysis** and **Return on Security Investment (ROSI)** for ransomware mitigation:  
  - **Potential Loss:** \$2M  
  - **Control Investment:** \$100K (EDR) + \$40K annual training  
  - **ROSI:** Positive (risk reduction > control cost)
- Please check readme.md in component_3 for full details [Risk Treatment & Cost-Effectiveness](Component_3#readme).
---

## 🔁 Implementation & Metrics
- Designed a **3-phase implementation plan** for deploying prioritized controls.  
- Defined **security performance metrics** to measure control efficiency and cost-effectiveness (e.g., mean detection time, ROI trend).  
- Proposed periodic **risk reassessment schedule** (annual full review + quarterly updates).

---

## 📘 Key Takeaways
✅ Demonstrated ability to perform **end-to-end risk management** from asset evaluation to control implementation.  
✅ Applied **quantitative modeling** (ALE, ROSI) to support **data-driven decision making**.  
✅ Translated **framework-based governance (NIST, ISO 27001)** into **practical, measurable risk outcomes**.  
✅ Strengthened skills in **cyber governance, risk quantification, and security control prioritization**.
