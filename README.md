# 🧩 SolarWinds Cyber Risk Management Program (SolarWinds Case Study)

**Author:** Luekrit Kongkamon 
**Duration:** September 2024 – November 2024  
**Role:** Cyber Risk Analyst (Academic Project)  
**Frameworks & Tools:** NIST SP 800-30 | ISO 27001 | BIA | CIA Triad | CIS Controls | SIEM | EDR | ROSI | TCO  

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Evaluate and classify assets** (physical, digital, human) based on the **CIA Triad** and **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**.  
2. **Develop risk evaluation methods** using both **qualitative** and **quantitative** assessments (SLE, ARO, ALE).  
3. **Design a monitoring and control strategy** using **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**, **SIEM**, and **EDR** tools.  
4. **Identify cost-effective risk treatments**, prioritizing controls through **ROSI** and **TCO** calculations.

## 🧱 Component 1: Asset Evaluation & Classification
- Created a complete **asset inventory** across physical, digital, and human resources.  
- Assigned **CIA Triad ratings** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) for each asset.  
- Conducted **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** with quantitative metrics to estimate **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**.

## 📈 Component 2: Evaluating & Monitoring Cyber Risk
- Applied **Qualitative Assessment** using expert judgment and risk matrices.  
- Applied **Quantitative Assessment** using **SLE × ARO = ALE** formula to quantify financial risk exposure.  
- Defined **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** to track threat trends (e.g., incident frequency, detection time, patching delays).  
- Developed a **Continuous Monitoring Plan** integrating **SIEM**, **EDR**, and **Threat Intelligence Feeds** for real-time visibility.

## 💰 Component 3: Cost-Effective Risk Treatment
- Evaluated four main **risk treatment options**: Avoidance, Reduction, Transfer, and Acceptance.  
- Prioritized **security controls** (e.g., EDR, phishing training, patch management) using **CIS Controls v8** alignment.  
- Conducted **Cost-Benefit Analysis** and **Return on Security Investment (ROSI)** for ransomware mitigation:  
  - **Potential Loss:** \$2M  
  - **Control Investment:** \$100K (EDR) + \$40K annual training  
  - **ROSI:** Positive (risk reduction > control cost)

## 🔁 Implementation & Metrics
- Designed a **3-phase implementation plan** for deploying prioritized controls.  
- Defined **security performance metrics** to measure control efficiency and cost-effectiveness (e.g., mean detection time, ROI trend).  
- Proposed periodic **risk reassessment schedule** (annual full review + quarterly updates).

## 📘 Key Takeaways
✅ Demonstrated ability to perform **end-to-end risk management** from asset evaluation to control implementation.  
✅ Applied **quantitative modeling** (ALE, ROSI) to support **data-driven decision making**.  
✅ Translated **framework-based governance (NIST, ISO 27001)** into **practical, measurable risk outcomes**.  
✅ Strengthened skills in **cyber governance, risk quantification, and security control prioritization**.
