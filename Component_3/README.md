## üßÆ Example: Ransomware Attack (ROSI Calculation)
Ransomware attacks pose a high risk to SolarWinds‚Äô data integrity and operational continuity. Using this scenario, the ROSI is calculated as follows (NIST, 2018; CIS, 2020; U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2021):

### üìå Assumptions
- **Potential Loss (SLE):** $2,000,000  
- **Suggested Security Controls:**  
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Initial Cost $100,000  
  - User Training (bi-annual): Annual Cost $40,000  
- **Total Cost of Ownership (3 years):**  
  TCO = Initial Cost + (Annual Cost √ó 3)  
  TCO = $100,000 + ($40,000 √ó 3) = **$220,000**  
- **Probability of Avoiding Risk:** 70%  

### üí∞ Calculation Steps
1. **Risk Reduction Benefit:**  
   = SLE √ó Probability of Avoiding Risk  
   = $2,000,000 √ó 0.7 = **$1,400,000**

2. **Return on Security Investment (ROSI):**  
   ROSI = ((Risk Reduction Benefit ‚Äì TCO) / TCO) √ó 100  
   ROSI = (($1,400,000 ‚Äì $220,000) / $220,000) √ó 100  
   ROSI = **536.4%**

### ‚úÖ Interpretation
The calculated ROSI indicates that investing $220,000 into ransomware protection yields a **return exceeding 500%**, demonstrating strong cost-effectiveness and operational benefit.

---

## üìà Insights
- **High ROSI (500%+):** Indicates strong justification for control implementation (e.g., encryption, EDR, backups).  
- **Medium ROSI (200‚Äì500%):** Represents balanced control efficiency with moderate risk coverage.  
- **Low ROSI (<200%):** Requires review to determine necessity or seek lower-cost alternatives.
